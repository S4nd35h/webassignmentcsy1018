        <p> The progress in assignments is going well </p>
        <p> It has been quite a harsh week trying to start this assignment.The codes aren't working mostly probably due to my own in competence. i spent about 2 hours trying to make a nav bar and it refused to work. Over all i hope ill be able to finish this soon</p>

        <h2> Mid progress</h2>
        <h4> Middle phase, feb 25,2022</h4>
        <p> I probably should've started the assignment sooner as i am scared i wont be able to submit it in time, also apparently the codes i wrote doesn't work or like the mobile view is crammed, i just hope i dont have to scrap it and start all over again.</p>

        <h2> End progress</h2>
        <h4> Ending phase, march 3rd,2022</h4>
        <p> I had to scrap the files because it didn't work, also i had to upload the files to git hub through out the assignment work but i overlooked that part so i now only have 3 days left and have to build a whole webpage from scratch since the time is limited i will probabby go with a simplistic design even though my grades will probably be very bad i just don't want to fail this has been a dream of mine to study computing but its too late ti wish i probably should have considered all of it way before but i guess you learn through your mistakes.All i hope is i get a passing mark and i swear i will do better this will be my goal from now " to not take everything for granted and time doesn't stop for anyone.</p>
