        <h1>Reflective discussion of module experience</h1>
        <p> As for my module experience, I wouldn’t say it was bad or anything but it wasn’t easy it was challenging but in a weird way. The teacher is incredibly nice and warm and teaches very well. It has been a rather pleasant experience but from what I have heard the next module is incredibly hard/challenging especially if you are a beginner in this field hope I can understand it well to not fail it </p>

        <h1> Design Decisions</h1>
        <h4>Design,UI and technical decisions i made along the way</h4>
        <p>My journey as I went along developing this webpage was eye-opening, there were many bugs and design concepts I had to go through. Spending hours trying to find a single replaced bracket was quite a pain but learning was a process. I had initially spent about 2-3 days making rough diagrams of how I wanted my web page to look like I was naïve.it took me extra two more days but as I was looking for ways to find ways to implement it into my website I was sad to find out that I had to learn a java-script for it to become fruitful so thus I went back to the designing board. As some with no prior coding knowledge, it was quite tasking to understand how codes worked and having ADHD also doesn’t help.
        As for design decisions, I was wandering through the web one day and I found a paper about colour theory and about how colours affect our human emotions so I choose the colours that provided the calmest/most curious response from a human. I am not sure whether it worked or not.i didn’t really had gotten influenced by any sort of websites but I did take references from the slides provided from the uni and some for the hamburger icon as I couldn’t really understand how to do it in css, the links of such are given in the references.
